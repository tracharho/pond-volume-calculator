# pond-volume-calculator

This is a tkinter gui application to perform quick pond volume calculations between 2 surface areas.

Takes in three inputs: Surface area one (sq. ft.,) surface area two(sq. ft.,) and the height (ft.) It then returns the volume in cubic feet of the pond. 
Uses the conic method to calculate the volume: V = d((A1 + sqrt(A1*A2) + A2)/3)

#TODO 
Add in multiple stages
Refractor for user input
